class Recursion
  # Warmup
  # Write a recursive method, range, that takes a start and an end and returns an array of all numbers in that range, exclusive. For example, range(1, 5) should return [1, 2, 3, 4]. If end < start, you can return an empty array.
  # Write both a recursive and iterative version of sum of an array.

  def self.range(start, end)
    # TODO
  end
